1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)



2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
Assignment 2 was my favorite. I have very limited programming experience, and I had never written web application before taking this course. I also had no idea how web pages could possibly be rendered dynamically (I also did not know what browzers were and servers were -- I still don't know a lot, but I really did not know anything coming into this class). In Assignment 2, I learned how web pages are dynamically modified, what APIs are, and how APIs can be used in a web application, among others. It was simply very "cool" to learn the basics of how web applications worked, because I interact with them every minute of the day yet I knew almost nothing about how they worked.


3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I had only taken Comp 11 and 15 before taking this course, and in those two courses, I barely researched anything myself to complete assignments. For Comp 20, however, I was consistently forced to look documentations as well as websites like stackoverflow to learn information necessary to complete assignments. Although I don't think I have developed my skills as a software engineer tremendously, I now feel more comfortable seeing new languages and environments, and I feel that if I try hard enough, I can learn much more on my own.


4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
I learned that the ability to look up available information online (documentations, Google, stackoverflow, etc.) and self-learn new programming languages and environments is so critical. A few weeks into this course, I realized that there was no way I can learn everything about GitHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScripts, and *list goes on* in class. For example, in "Old Kentucky Home" lab, I could not figure out why my page was not rendering the lyrics at all. I had to do a lot of Googling, and eventually I figured out that my use of quotations and double-quotations were not correct (use of single and double quotations). Another example is especially for Assignment 2, I had to read a lot about XMLHTTPRequest, call-back functions, anonymous functions, etc. Even going through the readings provided by Ming took more than a few hours, but I needed to look up much more information. It was clealry more information than what could be taught in two 75-minutes lectures a week, and I realized that we can only learn about the bigger picture concepts in class, and all the specifics need to be learned outside. Then it occurred to me that there will be no TA office hours once I am working in a company -- to me, the idea still feels very scary, but I also know that I either become capable of self-learning, or be useless, and I would rather be the former than the latter.


5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
As much as front-end interface design feels more familier to me, I realized how imporpant the back-end servers are. I am currently taking Database Systems as well, and designing databases is actually a lot of fun! Before taking 20 and 115, I thought storing data is as simple as just storing data, and there is not much more to it. Throughout this semester, I learned more that there are SQL and NoSQL databases with each having different strengths and weaknesses, and with ever-increasing amount of information we can obtain, I think it would be fun to play around with databases to figure out the most efficient and "fit" database for each given application.
