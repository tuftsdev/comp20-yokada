ANSWER TO THE QUESTION "is it possible to request the data from a different origin (e.g., http://messagehub.herokuapp.com/) or from your local machine (from file:///) from using XMLHttpRequest? Why or why not?":

--> the answer seems to be No! => same origin policy


From Wiki: For security reasons, XMLHttpRequest requests follow the browser's same-origin policy, and will therefore only succeed if they are made to the host that served the original web page.
