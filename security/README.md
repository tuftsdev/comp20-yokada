**1. Introduction** <br>
The product *landmarks* is a web application that takes the user's login and current location, and render the user, other users of *landmarks* who have checked in, and historic landmarks that are within one mile of the user's current location onto Google Map. Additionally, the users can query for the list of all the check-ins by the entire set of users up to now, and the users can also query for the check-ins made by the user with specified login. Because the product *landmarks* was developed by a student software engineer with limited experience with web application, the software engineer was allowed (and in fact, forced) to ignore any security concerns whatsoever. Therefore, I am hired to inspect *landmarks* and solve security flaws in order to improve the application to be more secure.
